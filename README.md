# NLP_ChartBot
Simple chatbot implementation with PyTorch.

The implementation should be easy to follow for beginners and provide a basic understanding of chatbots.
The implementation is straightforward with a Feed Forward Neural net with 2 hidden layers.
Customization for your own use case is super easy. Just modify intents.json with possible patterns and responses and re-run the training (see below for more info).
The approach is inspired by this article and ported to PyTorch: https://chatbotsmagazine.com/contextual-chat-bots-with-tensorflow-4391749d0077.
